# Texas A&M University System Security Control Standards Catalog

The Texas A&M University System security control standards catalog provides protective measures for information systems, organizations, and individuals.

The `tamus-cyber/tamus-control-standards` project repository is organized as follows:

| Directory | Description |
|---|---|
| content | Native OSCAL XML files that are used to build control catalogs, profiles, etc. |

Contributions and feedback for future control standards releases are welcome via GitHub. [Please open a new issue with your feedback](https://github.com/tamus-cyber/tamus-control-standards/issues).

Machine-readable formats compliant with the Open Security Controls Assessment Language ([OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/)) are available in the [projectâ€™s GitHub repository](https://github.com/tamus-cyber/tamus-control-standards) within `content`.
