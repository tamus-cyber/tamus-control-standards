## Cookie Policy

This Cookie Policy applies to the cookies we use when you visit Texas A&M University System’s main website ([www.tamus.edu](https://www.tamus.edu)) and other websites that we own or control and link or refer to this Cookie Policy (together, the “**Sites**”).

This cookie policy provides you with more information about cookies, what types of cookies we use and how we use them. Our Sites use cookies with the intention of providing you with a user experience that best suits your needs, while concurrently allowing us to improve the design and functionality of our Sites. Cookies can be adjusted or disabled, and this policy provides you with instructions to do so.

### Cookies

A cookie is a file designed to contain a small amount of user and website information stored on a user’s computer. The file interacts with the user and the website to provide a webpage tailored to the user through its awareness of information held within the file. Cookies also have the ability to carry all or parts of the information stored within the file to other websites that the user may visit or to third parties.

### Types of Cookies

A third-party cookie is placed by a domain other than that of the website the user is visiting.

A session cookie is temporary, linking the actions of a user during the any given browser session. When the browser is closed, the cookie is deleted.

A permanent cookie, also known as a persistent cookie, is stored for a specific period of time and activates each time the user visits the website that created the cookie.

### Our Use of Cookies

We use third-party, session and persistent cookies and similar technology to collect aggregate (non-personal) information about Sites usage by all of our visitors and to help us remember you and your preferences when you revisit the Sites. These cookies may stay on your browser into the future until they expire or you delete them. We also use technology to remember you the next time you log in. Some of these cookies are erased when you close your browser window and some persist for a period of time. Further general information about cookies and how they work is available at [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org).

We may allow selected third parties to place cookies through the Sites to provide us with better insights into the use of the Sites or user demographics or to provide relevant advertising to you. These third parties may collect information about a user’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Sites.

### Adjusting Cookie Settings

You can change your cookie settings by reviewing your internet browser’s cookie options. Most popular browsers will help you understand your cookie options better by visiting their technical support web pages or in the actual browser software itself. Typically, such information can be found under the browser’s ‘Help,’ ‘Preferences’ or ‘Options’ menus.

### Interest-Based Advertisements

Some of our Sites engage in online interest-based advertising to enhance your experience and show you advertisements that might interest you. Like many organizations, we and our advertising partners display tailored interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our Sites. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as searching on our Sites or visiting websites that contain our content or ads. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and we use a range of advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers.

To learn more about interest-based ads or to opt-out of receiving third-party interest-based ads, please visit [youradchoices.com](https://youradchoices.com) or [youronlinechoices.eu](https://youronlinechoices.eu). Please note that if you opt out of interest-based advertising, you will still see advertisements – they will just not be tailored to your interests. Also note that deleting browser cookies can remove the cookie preferences you have made, so you may need to opt-out again in the future.

### Blocking Cookies

Should you choose to decline or block cookies by adjusting your browser settings, including cookies essential to the Sites, please note that all or parts of our Sites may not be functional or accessible to you. Our Sites will issue cookies as soon you visit the Sites unless your browser cookie settings are adjusted to prevent such an occurrence. Please review the information provided in this cookie policy on adjusting cookie settings for the browser of your choice.

## Sharing your Personal Information

We share your information internally to facilitate and manage the purposes listed above. This includes third parties with whom A&M System members engage to process your Personal Information on our behalf for the purposes stated above, such as vendors who help the A&M System members with marketing, application processing, and web hosting. A&M System members may also share your Personal Data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators to (1) comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement applicable to us; (2) enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) pursue available legal remedies or defend against legal claims. Other third parties as you may so request are permitted by this and other A&M System policies and applicable laws and regulations. The A&M System will not sell any Personal Information to third parties for their use in direct marketing, advertising, or promotion of their products or services, but may be subject to open record requests.

## International Transfer of Personal Information

If you reside outside of the United States, we will ask you to consent in providing us with your Personal Information. This serves as an acknowledgment that your information will be transferred to the U.S. and processed on servers in the U.S. However, all reasonable steps will be taken to protect your privacy in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

## Non-personally Identifiable Information we Collect and Process

Standard, non-personally identifiable internet log information such as browser type and navigation to various parts of the Sites, in an aggregated form, is collected for analytical purposes to improve the browsing experience of our Sites, update relevant content, and improve the overall design. We may also collect information such as this for cybersecurity purposes to protect your information.

If you are an individual located in the EEA only, you will have the following rights with regard to your Personal Data:

1. **Right of access.**  
  You may request details of your Personal Information that we hold. We will confirm whether we are processing your Personal Information and we will disclose supplementary information including the categories of Personal Information, the sources from which it originated, the purpose and legal basis for the processing, the expected retention period, and the safeguards regarding Personal Information transfers to non-EEA countries, subject to the limitations set out in applicable statutes, regulations and other laws.

9. **Right to withdraw consent.**  
  You have the right to withdraw any consent you may have previously given us at any time. If you withdraw your consent, this will not affect the lawfulness of our collecting, using and sharing of your Personal Information up to the point in time that you withdraw your consent.

10. **Right to complain to a supervisory authority.**  
  * If you are not satisfied with our response, you have the right to complain to or seek advice from a supervisory authority and/or bring a claim against us in any court of competent jurisdiction.

They will respond to your written request without unreasonable delay and in accordance with any deadlines imposed by law. Unless we notify you at the time of your request, you will not be charged any fee in connection with the exercising of your rights.  
  &nbsp;

## Document Retention

We keep your Personal Information for as long as needed to fulfill the particular purpose for which it was collected.
