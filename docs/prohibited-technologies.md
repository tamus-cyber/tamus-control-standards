## Guidance

The Texas A&M University System follows the Texas Governor's directive dated December 7, 2022 in our implementation of the "Preventing Use of Prohibited Technology" policy and Chapter 620, Tex. Gov't Code. Details may be found at [DIR's website](https://dir.texas.gov/information-security/prohibited-technologies).

To assist A&M System members in making procurement and implementation decisions involving affiliates and subsidiaries of prohibited entities, the TAMUS Prohibited Entity Affiliates/Subsidiaries Repository has been established to serve as a central point to document and access discoveries of such affiliates and subisidaries by system members.
